# Jason

Parse JSON...kind of.

Jason is not spec compliant and does not handle Unicode escape sequences.

## Usage

```javascript
// index.js

import Jason from 'this module, however you choose to install it'

const jason = new Jason()

const yourNewObject = jason.parse('{"key":"value"}')

enjoy(yourNewObject)
```
